# School In The Cloud

## ‚òùÔ∏è **Pitch**

School in the Cloud is a platform that trains senior volunteers to teach students in a group or individual setting. This helps kids in communities with high student to teacher ratios. It also provides retired volunteers a sense of purpose and meaning in their day to day life when they find themselves with more free time. The platform also connects volunteers with the students. 

The aim is to help close the achievement gap by connecting students with available, qualified volunteer mentors. The first piece of this app will be creating the three main user types, and allowing an admin to create a training checklist for new volunteers.

## ‚úÖ  **MVP**
1. On-boarding for three user types: `admin`, `student`, and `volunteer`. Each user type will have their own view.

2. Ability for an `admin` to create and edit a training ‚Äú`tasks`‚Äù volunteers to complete. Saving a to do list will make it appear on the volunteers homepage.

3. Homepage for `volunteer` to view their `tasks` from an `admin`.

4. Homepage for `student`s to see the profiles of all registered `volunteers`. They can search by their listed `availability time`s, or their `country`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Stretch**
1. Ability for `volunteer` to check off `items` in their `tasks`, and progress is reported back to the `admin`.

2. Ability for a `student` to schedule a `time` to meet with a `volunteer` (see the Github for previous flex together project which worked on scheduling ability).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
